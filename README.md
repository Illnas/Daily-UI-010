Daily UI 010

So, here I created a what is supposed to be a button, which when clicked, 
would show all the social sites like facebook, twitter, etc etc.
Thing is, it requires functionality which I could achieve with JS or with
React. Which lead me to just design possible button, and write down idea for
this project. And idea actually came from visiting Genshin Impact Website. 
At some time, their website page had a list of all the social websites stacked
one upon another. And it was pretty long list, if you conclude in it all the
asian social websites. 

Well, idea is here, and I already did design, all that is left is to 
give it life (functionality). 

Let's see what next challenges brings!
